<h1>2Lies1Fact</h1>
2Lies1Fact is a game where players have to guess which of three statements is a fact. The other two are lies.
There are two game modes available:
<ol>
  <li>Classic Mode: The player starts with three hearts and loses one for each mistake. If all the hearts are lost, the game ends.</li>
  <li>Timer Mode: The player has 45 seconds to find the fact. If the time runs out or they click on the wrong one, the game ends.</li>
</ol>
The game won't work without the backend. You can get it <a href="https://github.com/DHBW-N/2Lies1Fact-API">here.</a>
